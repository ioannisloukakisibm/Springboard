customer.csv is our customer database.
in the following try - except bblock We first Check if we have customers already or if the current is the only customer.

"""
The rest of the code is designed for the user interaction with the system. 
It is a series of try-except statements, while loops and conditionals designed to prevent the user from entering wrong information.
In each step, the user can type 'exit; to abort and get out of the program.
At the end of each code block, we use the classes created in the Classes.py program to populate our database (csv) 
with the new information entered by the user.
